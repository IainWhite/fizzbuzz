# FizzBuzz
## Some FizzBuzz examples. ##

[FizzBuzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) was originally a game to help kids to learn the mathematical division by playing with numbers.
If a number has a given factor, it is replaced with the matching word: _"Fizz"_ when divisible by 3, _"Buzz"_ when divisible by 5. 

Later **FizzBuzz** becomes a well known short programming problem to select developer candidates.
